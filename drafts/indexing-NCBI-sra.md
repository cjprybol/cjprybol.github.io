The end CPI sequence read archive is an online Data set repository funded by the US government allows anyone, including public and private institutions, to upload archive store and retrieve sequencing data sets for public and private use. This is an incredible resource because it puts so much data at the availability of anyone with an Internet connection, however, finding data sets relevant to what you're searching for and being able to find Data sets in the archives that are most similar to Data sets that you already have can be very difficult due to the variability in metadata associated with each sample. Utilizing the same camera feature frequency profile discussed previously that is useful for species identification and taxonomic classification it should be possible to generate Kaymer figure kaymer feature frequency profiles the data sets and then utilize these Kaymer feature frequency profiles to build a hierarchical tree showing the relationship between each sample in this sequence read archive to every other sample in the sequence read archive which would allow for an unbiased and automated way of finding samples most similar to the samples that you already have to work with in the events that you would like to increase your sample size and expand the power of what you are doing.
