I recently submitted an application for [OFRF's 2019 request for letters of intent](https://ofrf.org/2019-request-letters-intent) with the hope of acquiring funding on 2020 to analyze publicly available soil metagenomics datasets and make the results interactively available to farmers, ranchers, researchers, and the public at large. The goal is to establish some baselines for soil biological diversity, make those baselines available, and gain additional experience to start offering soil metagenomic analysis as a service to myself as a farmer and to others who are looking to improve the biological diversities of their soil for improved crop health, resilience, productivity, and nutrient density. My responses to the checklist areas are below

1\. *Rationale. What is the issue that you are addressing and why is it important to organic producers? Farmers and ranchers are OFRF’s primary constituency; does your proposal address an identified farmer or rancher need or needs such as those outlined in OFRF’s National Organic Research Agenda? (250 words)*

Microbes influence the resilience, productivity, and nutrient availability of soils that farmers and ranchers depend on for producing their harvests. Many resources are available to help farmers and ranchers understand the biochemical qualities of their soils, as well as assessing the presence or absence of specific pest organisms such as plant parasites. However, options for assessing the full spectrum of biological diversity in soils are still generally limited to academic and institutional research labs, making most of the information about what kinds of organisms are in soils around the United States and how different farming practices influence these communities out of reach of the majority of food producers. I propose to analyze publicly available DNA sequencing datasets of various soils and various growing practices and to make the results of these analyses publicly available in an interactive web-based format for farmers and ranchers to explore. I will also analyze publicly available DNA sequencing datasets of human and ruminant gut microbiomes to demonstrate how similar these communities of organisms are to the communities in soil, thus emphasizing how interconnected soil health and human/livestock health are at the microbial level.

2\. *Research Objectives. What are the specific objectives and goals of the project? For each objective or goal, present a measurable outcome that will indicate successful achievement of the objective. (200 words)*

Objective 1: Assemble DNA sequences into chromosomes and genomes.  
- Rationale: It is necessary to reassemble the DNA fragments present in each dataset into the longer DNA segments of chromosomes and genomes of the organisms originally present within the samples before it is possible to ask which organisms are present or determine their relative frequencies.  
- Outcome: FASTA files.  

Objective 2: Identify species that are present.  
- Rationale: The assembled DNA sequences can be compared against collections of organisms with known genomes to identify which species are present. DNA sequences that do not closely match any known species can be analyzed to find the closest related species.  
- Outcome: Tables associating assembled sequences to closest known species.  

Objective 3: Quantify the relative frequencies of organisms.  
- Rationale: By counting the number of times DNA sequences from each organism were observed, it is possible to determine the relative, although not the absolute, frequencies of the organisms in the communities sampled.  
- Outcome: Tables of species counts  

Objective 4: Generate interactive, publicly accessible visualizations of the results of objectives 2 & 3.  
- Rationale: Farmers, ranchers, and interested 3rd parties can learn how organism diversity differs by location, farming practices, and habitat (soil, rumen, gut).  
- Outcome: A webpage.  

3\. *Research description/methods. Describe the hypothesis for the proposed research; the main treatments or study population; location and scope of the trials; and measurements to be taken.  (200 words)*

Hypothesis: The soil microbiome and the gut/rumen microbiome are intimately linked. The role of dietary fiber and other biochemical nutrients in affecting the gut/rumen microbiome is well documented, however less attention has been paid to how crops grown in biologically active soils will harbor microbial communities similar to the soils they are grown in. Humans and livestock consuming these crops will also consume these microbial populations, giving these soil borne microbes the opportunity to colonize and influence the gut/rumen microbiome and health of these livestock and humans.  
Study Populations: Publicly available soil and gut microbiome datasets.  
Location: US only.  
Scope: at least 12 samples.  
Measurements: Species present and relative frequencies in each sample.

4\. *Research outreach and results dissemination. What is your outreach plan for delivering project outcomes to farmers, ranchers, or other end users? (125 words)*

In addition to the primary objective of producing a publicly accessible and interactive web page of the results as an educational resource, I will submit proposals and abstracts to local and regional conferences related to soil health as well as organic farming and ranching to raise awareness and engage target audiences. Examples of potential conferences include:
- Soil Health Institute Annual Meeting
- Sustainable Agriculture Conference
- Southern SAWG conference

5\. *Innovation and adoptability. How innovative is your approach to addressing the research issue? How useful and adoptable will the results be for farmers and ranchers? (100 words)*

To understand the health of soil, it is necessary to assess both biological and biochemical properties. Resources for understanding the biochemical properties of soil are more prevalent and advanced than those available for understanding the biological properties. Innovation in the biological assessment of soil health is essential for a comprehensive understanding of how to best manage our soil resources. Farmers and ranchers looking to learn more about the health of their soils can compare the biological diversity of their soils with those assessed by this project for immediate usefulness regarding management practices benefiting soil health.

6\. *Farmer involvement. How have farmers or ranchers been involved in the development of the proposal idea? What role will farmers or ranchers play in the proposed project? (125 words)*

Yes. Several farmers that I have worked with have been involved in discussions to help shape this research proposal through dialogues about what aspects of soil microbiology interest them and what kind of impact various information about soil health would have on their production methods. Additionally, farmers have been involved indirectly by having worked many of the soil sample plots that would be evaluated for this project.

7\. *Qualifications. Briefly describe primary team members, including the project leader and other key cooperators. Descriptions should demonstrate the ability to manage the project, conduct research activities, and provide full financial oversight. Name the individuals, their organizational affiliation, and their primary responsibilities in the project. (125 words)*

Cameron Prybol - PhD level training in genetics with 4 years of vegetable growing experience, 1 year of experience rotationally grazing cattle, and 6 months of experience with sheep, swine, and poultry. Extensive research and reading related to soil health and production methods that increase soil organic matter and biological activity. Project management and research skills have been developed over nearly a decade of undergraduate and graduate level research. Full financial oversight can be provided in the form of itemized cost receipts from cloud computing providers where analyses will be performed. Current relevant affiliation(s): Fickle Creek Farm, Efland, NC.

8\. *Organic certification. Is the research area on certified organic land? Yes or no. This excludes Priority Areas 6 and 6a.*

Yes
