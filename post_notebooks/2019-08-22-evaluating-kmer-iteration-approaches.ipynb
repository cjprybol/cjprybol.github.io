    "A kmer is a k-length subsequence of DNA (or RNA). Kmers are ubiquitously useful in genomics and assembly in particular. Checkout the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer) and [this amazing post](https://bioinfologics.github.io/post/2018/09/17/k-mer-counting-part-i-introduction/) for more details and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to work with unix command line tools. There are many kmer counters out there ([Jellyfish](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish) and [KMC](https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC) are the first two that come to mind), but require pre-existing knowledge about how many kmers are expected (when setting up hash tables) or complex setups. Wouldn't it be great if we could just dump all kmers to STDOUT and then use unix tools to sort and count the kmers? I think so too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three approaches for iterating over kmers using the [BioSequences](https://github.com/BioJulia/BioSequences.jl) package in Julia that jumped out to me. The first, most naive solution would be to take a k-length slice from the sequence. The second is to take a k-length view of the sequence, which avoids creating a copy and should be more efficient than the slice. The third is to use the Kmer iterators in the BioJulia package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kmers can be useful in both their observed and canonical (alphabetically first orientation) forms, so we'll evaluate both to see if different approaches are faster for different orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the benchmarking, we'll be comparing the speed of prime k-lengths between 7 and 31, using both as-observed and canonical orientations. Note that all forms are written to /dev/null to simulate writing to STDOUT for piping to other unix commands."

    "So it turns out that it doesn't matter whether we take slices or views. This could be because a copy of the sequence has to be made to print it to STDOUT anyway, negating the memory allocation savings of the view approach. Both approaches are 3x-10x faster than using the Kmer iterations provided in BioJulia. For this particular use case, I think it makes the most sense to go with the simplest, the slice."
